1 framework and 1 language to get a job first

- front-end (javascript & react)
    * we do want the portfolio to be a react app (good job)
    * design doesnt have to be INCREDIBLE, but because you're front-end it has to be decent
    * designer = UI, front-end = UX

    * 3 paths
        1. Front-end Designer (not you) html/css/jquery
        2. JavaScript engineer (this is NO CSS / HTML - heavy algorithm stuff heavy JS)
        3. Front-end application developer (simple mixture of the above 2)

    * easiest beginner path is #3 -> so the movie app you're building is the perfect #3 aligned #3

Next Actions:
1. We need a portfolio app that is SIMPLE NOT INCREDIBLE 
    A. Buidl this portfolio following tutorial https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-portfolio-website-react/ 
        Simple protocol:
            - Close all other code and windows even all other web browser 
            - Open new folder in visual studio for this code and focus and just do this 1 thing
            - Set micro goals of 15m, 20m focus simplicity then if you achieve it a little break of 5-10m break (catch: not allowed to do toxic behavior)
                * expand that if its too easy (expand to 45m, expand to 1h, or etc)
        Tutorial following protocol:
            - Never copy paste - open code on one monitor open tutorial on other
            - Literally write by hand every word of the tutorial
            - Even if you dont understand the code, keep going (if you do this enough your subconscious brain will create a network of nodes (assuming baseline level of intelligence) and then after a few tutorials you literally get a momenty of INSIGHT "ah omg I undertstand that piece of code" (literally goes from the bottom UP to your coonscious brain)
        Why do I make you do this tutorial protocol?
            - Learning top down is the most difficult thing ever (conscious to subconscious)
            - Learning bottom up is the easiest thing ever (subconscious to conscious)
            

2. We need the movie app ready to deploy looking SOMEWHAT DECENT (after the tutorial for portfolio)

The most important study technology ever made is:
1. Gradients (step by step by step) so never learn more than 1 step ahead of where u are now
    - The portfolio you'ree doing now is about 4 steps - 8 steps ahead


Complexity fallacy (huge prtoblem in the brain b/c entropy -> 2nd law of thermodynamics)
